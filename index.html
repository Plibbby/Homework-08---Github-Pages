		<p> This is Niko, a biakal seal! I love these little guys, they prefer colder waters and Baikal seals are earless seal from lake Baikal in Siberia. Niko is from Japan! He is very popular online as he is super friendly. He is trained to scrunch his face when the word "gua" is said. They are very closly related to Ladoga ringed seal, another cute and popular seal. </p>
